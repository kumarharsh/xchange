## Introduction
This project, xchange, uses the Yahoo Finance API to pull in near real-time data about the currencies.
Users start off with a base account balance, which they can use to buy(long) or sell(short) currencies.

## Features
A live feed of the current leaderboard.
A variety of global currencies. Add your own currencies here:
    include/currencyInfo.txt



The project is really old, and so a lot of the things would seem ridiculous to you, so ofcourse, go ahead and play with whatever component you feel like, and make it better.
